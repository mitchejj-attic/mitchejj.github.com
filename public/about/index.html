I am a manager at Panera Bread, a graduate of Grand Valley State University with a degree in Computer Science, a geek, a runner and a runDisney fan. Here you will find a unique blend of tech, running and everyting I find interesting to fill the gaps. 
</aside>

<p>I graduated <a href="http://gvsu.edu">Grand Valley State University</a> with a degree in Computer Science. I however, have not put my degree to any use since graduation. Instead I opted to work for <a href="http://panerabread.com">Panera Bread</a>. Thanks to this experience learned a lot and grown as an individual. Here will live digital workspace and playground. I will share personal thoughts, refine my writing style and explore different technologies and methodologies. Things may work, things may not work and things may break. As a result, nothing here should be considered finished, polished, refined or ready for mass consumption.</p>

<p>Sometime in the summer of 2011 I wanted to find an escape from my Google dependency. The first step was to move away from Google Mail (gMail), with that change I wanted to use my own domain. I wanted a short URL that could tie into both my geek side and my emerging heath consciousness, nothing unreasonable. I ran many ideas thru my Domain Register of choice <a href="https://www.hover.com/">hover.com</a>, nothing resonated with until <a href="http://stderr.me">stderr.me</a>.</p>

<pre><code>stderr == Standard Error
</code></pre>

<p>stderr.me has now become my “personal brand,” and honestly I don’t think it is all that ideal to brand oneself as a standard error. However, it works, for now. That does leave the obvious question then why standard error. A few reasons. First, we all have ‘errors’ in our daily lives. They could be technology related, heath related or just our personalties. I order to resolve these errors they need to be exposed to the world. Second, the domain name was cheap and fitted my criteria listed above.</p>

<p>As of right now I’m hosting my email on my ‘<a href="http://discuss.joyent.com/viewtopic.php?id=33682&amp;p=34">lifetime</a>’ shared hosting account with Joyent and filtering out the spam with <a href="http://mailroute.net">mailroute.net</a>, I’m happy with the set up. Things my change now that Joyent EOL my ‘lifetime’ account.</p>

<p>Once I partially migrated away from Google I felt need to have a web presence yet again. I just didn’t want to host something myself, uptime shouldn’t be the time I spend worrying about security issues and keeping everything up-to-date. Right away two choice seemed ideal, tumblr and posterous. Tumblr won out with a better domain name mask scheme and a larger community. As started working on a theme(s) and building on what I learned with the previous iteration I found myself annyoed with how tumblr works. As a result I just didn’t use it as much as I hoped.</p>

<p>Now I’m self hosting again, kind of. I’m using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, “the blog-aware static site generator” coupled with <a href="http://github.com">github</a> for versioning and source control with the final site deployed on a single <a href="http://heroku.com">heroku</a> dyno. I hoping working on this site will help me rebalance my work life balance, I do intent spend at least an hour every other day mucking about on this “project”.</p>

<p>With that said I do have a small disclaimer. The initial genesis of this space was to create a playground where I may share my thoughts and experiences. This here will be my playground. Things may work, things may not work and things may break. As a result, nothing here should be considered finished, polished, refined or ready for mass consumption. My main quality goal is to keep the site light and nimble.</p>
