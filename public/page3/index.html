<p>I’ve been playing with Linux on two old Macbooks (4,1 and 2,1). The 4,1 system has Ubuntu while the 2,1 system is running Crunchbang. To me the stock Ubuntu install is a bit to much for me, and I much prefer the Crunchbang install. However I have EFI boot issues with the CB install.</p>

<p>So here are a few quick links:</p>

<p>grub-efi-amd64 is also a useful package’s… I think.</p>

<p>I was never a Facebook fan. I get the general point of the service to easily stay connected to friends and family. However maybe its because I’m not an overly social person, I never understood why so many people view the internet thru Facebook, or buy so heavily into the Facebook services. As a result I was more of a Twitter users.</p>

<p>I’ve preferred Twitter to Facebook because it had an open feeling. Something more noble where the service was “we the people.” Slowly that feeling is melting away. Many of the geek thought leaders have started looking else where. One of the first attempts at replacing Twitter was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identi.ca">identi.ca</a> back in the Twitter #failwhale days. It never caught on for various reasons. Today we have two other choices <a href="https://app.net">app.net</a> and <a href="http://tent.io/">Tent</a>.</p>

<p>App.net made the first big splash with a unique funding method, ask your end users to fund you. App.net philosophy is pure it simple make the backbone for the developers to build off of and make the end user the consumer not the product. It is a pay to play platform which will keep many away. At the same time I think that will help the service scale and allow for developers to build unique and interesting services for the next few years. The Twitter like functionality (alpha) is just a quaint fundraising side show.</p>

<p>We also have <a href="http://tent.io/">Tent</a>. However, unlike App.net, tent isn’t a platform, its a protocol for social networking. Not only that it is decentralized, which will ensure it stay open. Yet that brings upon it many problems such as long term interoperability. It isn’t a service nor is it a platform, but idea how social networking should function. I have high hope for the tent <a href="https://tent.is/">status app, tent.is</a> and hope it takes off. I however feel it has many growing pains ahead, the potential user base already has ideas and expectations. The status app must either evolve meet those expectations or refine itself to show the user a better way.</p>

<p>Of course these are my quick thoughts and haven’t really spent much time looking App.net or Tent. I like what I see with Tent, so <a href="https://mitchejj.tent.is/">signed up</a> with <a href="https://tent.is/">tent.is</a>. And the tent github wiki has a nice page <a href="https://github.com/tent/tent.io/wiki/Explaining-Tent">Explaining Tent</a>.</p>

			<h2>Run Mate</h2>
		</hgroup>
		<div><small>

		</div>
	</header>
	<section class="post">
		
<p>When I first started to run I would run excessive at the gym, indoors on a treadmill. The idea of running outside, where the elements and nature could interfere with my feeble attempt at running horrified me. I knew I need help to start running, couch to 5k apps where all the rage. They where all relatively cheap and similarly priced at $2.99. I knew I would eventually outgrow the 5k apps, as I was targeting completing a half-marathon. If I could find a training app that would aid in my endeavor I would be happy, I found such an app, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/run-mate/id322005319">Run Mate</a>.</p>

<p>I would not generally classify Run Mate as useful app away from a treadmill, but I may be wrong. I’ve since moved on to other tools as I dread running indoors and the bulk of my running takes place outdoors. At the core, Run Mate is a powerful, albeit, fickle utility. The User Interface shows some thought was give to the end user, Yet the UX is rough around the corners and implemented in the most vexing ways, that eventually grow tiresome. If you choose to use Run Mate, ignore sound prompts and rely solely on the voice overs. Also, avoid all temptation to pick up your iOS device to multitask or change tracks.</p>

<p>A user can easily create a training routine that fits their goals. I wanted to running an interval set using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training#Little_method">Little Method</a> this evening at the gym. I quickly configure a training plan before stepping on the treadmill, six minutes in I wondered why the first prompt had yet to fire. I checked the Run Mate, and sure enough it was on step four. I forgot that the sound prompts are essentially nonexistent, I changed the plan to use the dread voice prompts and started over.</p>

<p>I fact I’ve never once heard a sound prompt from Run Mate until later in the evening after a podcast I was listing to ended. My eyes wondering where wondering the computer screen and I heard these faint repetitive pings in the distant background. It was then I my ear buds where still affixed to my ears and my podcast was over. When I removed one bud the sound was isolated to the other ear. Odd, killing the process halted the pings, starting a run started the pings again. So yes, not only are the sound prompts faint and nonexistent the are also unreliable.</p>
