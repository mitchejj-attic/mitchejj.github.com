I must confess this has been an interesting journey. I gave up the idea of a blog awhile back when I stopped using S9Y aka senderdipity, and dropped my the domain I was using and all kinds of other things.

Then I started thinking wouldn't it be nice to post something larger than a tweet or reblog something... that lead me to tumblr. While I liked tumblr and the concept of having different layouts for different post types (images, video, quotes, text) and I loved the equally I didn't have to worry about keeping a sites backend up-to-date and I was getting a good content delivery stream. However, I wasn't a fan of the various limitations imposed by tumblr. In the end I just didn't use it as much as I liked because of that.

So I started looking else where and found chyrp. It seemed perfect, a nice clone of tumblr and was marked as a lightweight blogging engine. I deployed it on my server and went to work hack a theme that worked for me. But I didn't get to far, it had issues. One issue I just couldn't get past was it included a local copy of jQuery and a few other javascripts . I'm sorry but I'm looking for something quick and nimble, I don't want to be bouged down by weighty scripts, let alone server them up when CDN's exist for that very purpose.

Somehow that lead me to Jekyll. So far I'm impressed. It really is everything I want, I think. I'm given the freedom, to create and express myself with out worry about the server.
