### whoami
I'm Jason and this is my new online dwelling. I graduated [Grand Valley State University](http://gvsu.edu) with a degree in Computer Science. I however, have not put my degree to any use since graduation. Instead I opted to work for [Panera Bread](http://panerabread.com). Thanks to this experience learned a lot and grown as an individual. Here will live digital workspace and playground. I will share personal thoughts, refine my writing style and explore different technologies and methodologies. Things may work, things may not work and things may break. As a result, nothing here should be considered finished, polished, refined or ready for mass consumption.

Sometime in the summer of 2011 I wanted to find an escape from my Google dependency. The first step was to move away from Google Mail (gMail), with that change I wanted to use my own domain. I wanted a short URL that could tie into both my geek side and my emerging heath consciousness, nothing unreasonable. I ran many ideas thru my Domain Register of choice [hover.com](https://www.hover.com/), nothing resonated with until [stderr.me](http://stderr.me).

	stderr == Standard Error

stderr.me has now become my "personal brand," and honestly I don't think it is all that ideal to brand oneself as a standard error. However, it works, for now. That does leave the obvious question then why standard error. A few reasons. First, we all have ‘errors’ in our daily lives. They could be technology related, heath related or just our personalties. I order to resolve these errors they need to be exposed to the world. Second, the domain name was cheap and fitted my criteria listed above.

As of right now I'm hosting my email on my ‘[lifetime](http://discuss.joyent.com/viewtopic.php?id=33682&p=34)’ shared hosting account with Joyent and filtering out the spam with [mailroute.net](http://mailroute.net), I'm happy with the set up. Things my change now that Joyent EOL my 'lifetime' account.

Once I partially migrated away from Google I felt need to have a web presence yet again. I just didn’t want to host something myself, uptime shouldn't be the time I spend worrying about security issues and keeping everything up-to-date. Right away two choice seemed ideal, tumblr and posterous. Tumblr won out with a better domain name mask scheme and a larger community. As started working on a theme(s) and building on what I learned with the previous iteration I found myself annyoed with how tumblr works. As a result I just didn’t use it as much as I hoped.

Now I'm self hosting again, kind of. I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), "the blog-aware static site generator" coupled with [github](http://github.com) for versioning and source control with the final site deployed on a single [heroku](http://heroku.com) dyno. I hoping working on this site will help me rebalance my work life balance, I do intent spend at least an hour every other day mucking about on this "project".

With that said I do have a small disclaimer. This here will be my playground. Things may work, things may not work and things may break. As a result, nothing here should be considered finished, polished, refined or ready for mass consumption. My main quality goal is to keep the site light and nimble.
