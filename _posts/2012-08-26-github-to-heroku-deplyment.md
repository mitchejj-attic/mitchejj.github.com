Once again I'm taking inspiration from Jonas Forsberg and [Deploy to Heroku from Github](http://jonasforsberg.se/2012/07/29/deploy-to-heroku-from-github). However, I just couln't get the thing to work. So I backtracked to the orginal project [github-heroku-pusher](https://github.com/ajlai/github-heroku-pusher) and everything now seems to be in working order. I think I will circle back around to his method eventually, but for now, while I build out the site I'm going to follow the don't fix what isn't broken mantra.
