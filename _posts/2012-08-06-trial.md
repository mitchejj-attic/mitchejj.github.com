"I had this particular problem as well and here's how I got around it:
For OS 10.7 + XCode4.3 only open Xcode preferences, select the
"Downloads" button, select the "Components" tab of Downloads, highlight
"Command Line Tools" and press the install button.  Gem install rails
didn't give me any trouble after that.  Hope that works for you too,
