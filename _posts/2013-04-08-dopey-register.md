I've been going back and forth over this for the last week. I really want to do the the Wine & Dine for the 4th year in a row, I really want to tackle the Dopey Challenge. I only have the ability to do one of the weekends. I also don't know if this how I wanted to spend a weeks vacation. In the end the bigger regret would be not doing the Dopey Challenge.

I took advantage to the Disney Visa pre-registration offer and discount, only saving me $15 ;(
