I ordered my first [fitbit][1] on March 8th 2010, each day I wait in anticipation for production to ramp up. Finally on May 18th my fitbit shipped. Sadly my fitbit died a few month later, as I completed my first half marathon. I found out the hard way the fitbit wasn't water resistant at all. The fitbit also didn't seem very durable construction wise, but I didn't exactly wear it as directed. I'm sure that contributed to my original failing. Last year jawbone released their failed entry into the space, with the [Jawbone UP][2] shortly after that Nike announced their [FuelBand][3]. Each of those items had something the I wanted in the fitbit before making a replacement purchase, Bluetooth syncing to my phone. Today, fitbit announced two new products the [One][4] and the [Zip][5]. Both promise to sync via Bluetooth 4.0/Bluetooth Smart, and both are said to be water resistant (sweat,rain and the like). I really wanted to buy the One, but two things held me back. First, its pre-shipping order status and second the design looks similar enough to the original created a love-hate connection in my mind. While the Zip had one negative in my book, no sleep tracking. I placed an order for my Zip.
