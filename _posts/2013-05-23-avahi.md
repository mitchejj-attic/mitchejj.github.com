I've had issues getting avahi (zeroconfig) to work properly on my first arch install. 

I was, I think, finally able to make everything work properly by doing the following.

Edit `/etc/nsswitch.conf` and make the `host` line look like

	hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns

Edit `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` and comment out the line `noipv4ll`

Finally run

	# systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service
    

[nss-mDNS](http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/nss-mdns/)

Testing metric:
	
	ping -c 1 `hostname`.local
	avahi-resolve -n `hostname`.local
	getent hosts `hostname`
