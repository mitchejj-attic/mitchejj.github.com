I've had issues getting avahi (zeroconfig) to work properly on my first arch install. 

I was, I think, finally able to make everything work properly by doing the following.

Edit `/etc/nsswitch.conf` and make the `host` line look like [^mDNS]:

	hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns

Finally run:

	# systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service
    
Testing metric:
	
	ping -c 1 `hostname`.local
	avahi-resolve -n `hostname`.local
	getent hosts `hostname`

 [^mDNS]: More info on what mdns4_minimal and mdns can be found on the [nss-mDNS](http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/nss-mdns/) website.
