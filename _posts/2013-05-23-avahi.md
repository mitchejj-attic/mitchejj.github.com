I've had issues getting avahi (zeroconfig) to work properly on my first arch install.

While I could reach other systems using `hostname.local` and they would even see my arch.local install trying to access it via the hostname would always fail.

I was, I think, finally able to make everything work properly by doing the following.

Edit `/etc/nsswitch.conf` and make the `host` line look like

	hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns

Edit `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` and comment out the line `noipv4ll`

Finally run

	# systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service
    # avahi-set-host-name $(hostname)
