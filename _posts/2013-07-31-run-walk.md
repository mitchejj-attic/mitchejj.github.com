Late last year, a few weeks before my third Wine & Dine Half Marathon I suffered an injury to my knee. While I rested and worked out at the gym I had hopes I could not just salvage upcoming Wine & Dine but become healthy enough to run the Goofy in January. Well I was able to make it for the Wine & Dine, yet I managed to re-aggravated the injury around the 3-mile marker. I endured by hoping and skipping my way to finish line. Once I crossed the finish line I was certain I would have to drop out of the Goofy. Yet, a few weeks later I had a desire to at least line up and try. I went back to the gym followed a similar routine to the one I used to a few weeks earlier. Well I finished both, and the knee injury wasn't an issue.

Flash forward to late April to early May, the injury returned. I have followed a similar recovery plan, yet I'm not seeing the same success. I've now started to implement a run walk mix. I'm using Runmeter to track all my stats, I also use the built in interval trainer to prompt me when to run or walk. My current ratio is 2:45 run with a 1:15 walk. I think I need to a bit more complexity to this formula, after running this loop 10 times (40 minutes) I think I would like to toss in a 3:30 run followed my a 1:30 walk. So far so go.
