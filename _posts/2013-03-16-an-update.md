I must admit I haven't said much in some time.

I've nearly migrated my full computer usage from my Mini running OS X to my old MacBook running [CrunchBang Linux][1], with a few modificatons. So far I'm liking the switch. Not because its free or any such ideology. This set up is must less computing intensive, and I feel like I'm living closer to the hardware. It a way I feel more conected with the technology.

I've also started to use [SparkleShare][2] more than DropBox, moved my email to [FastMail][3].
