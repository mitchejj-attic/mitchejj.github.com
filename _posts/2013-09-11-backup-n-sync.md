I've been searching for the best backup/sync solution since I've moved over to linux. I want a soulution that I can easily access my data from my iPhone and OS X devices.

Last Christmas I did purchase a discounted Crash Plan plan. However, I'm not a fan of having the cliet program run in Java. So I quickly dropped that solution. Dropbox is great for keeping & sharing files in sync it isn't a backup solution. I tried SparkleShare, which gives a person version control, but if you storing the files out of your control it probally is a good idea to enable cryto. Doing so you loose version control.

A few weeks ago I tried duplicity, I like it but where do I store my off site backups? Also do I really want to trust myself to creating a script that works all the time? I've also tried BitSync, which keeps files in sync but lacks any version control, no off site back-up and two systems must be running for this to work.

SpiderOak still isn't ideal, but right now it seems to be the best bad choice.
