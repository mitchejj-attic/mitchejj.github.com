I was a huge watch person in the later years of HS and most of my college life. Then sometime in my senior year I stop wearing a watch. It wasn't untill early this year I start wearing a watch on a semi-regular basis.

But first let me back track, once I decided I was going to make an attempt at the Goofy Challenge in `13 I wanted to find a way to track my effort in a qualitive way. I thought the best method would be using a hear rate monitor. My main running gadget/companion up d to then had been my iPhone. Before the iPhone 4s if you wanted to use any fitness gadgets that would interact with an app on a smart phone you choice was ANT+ and a dongle. I just purchased an iPhone 4s which support for Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth Smart), so the obvious choice was the [Wahoo Fitness Blue HR][hrBlue]. I used it for some time, but I son realized it wasn't exactly what I wanted. I wasn't a fan of the strap.

Shortly after I started to cool on the HR Blue, I learned of the a new [Kickstarter project][alphaKick] the [Mio Alpha][miroAlpha], a heart rate monitor watch. The watch is great for the uni-tacker functionality it provides. Over the weekend I read an execet review of the Megallan Echo over at [DC Rainmaker][dcReview].
