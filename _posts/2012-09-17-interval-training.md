I was listing podcast the other day where they where talking about HIIT, High Intensity Interval Training.; more specifically the Tabata and Little Methods. I wasnâ€™t able to sleep last night and figured I would look into the Little Method more. Only to find the infographic above from the same source I linked to the other day, <http://greatist.com/>, they my soon have a place in my daily reading line up. Oh, and I plan on using Little Method when I visit the gym for a short 30 minute run this evening.

>The protocol calls for 60 seconds of high intensity followed by 75 seconds of low intensity. Repeat for a total of 12 cycles (totaling 27 minutes) up to three times per week.
