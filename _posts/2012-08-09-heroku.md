After playing with jekyll on Git Hub's pages, I realized I needed something with a bit more zest. I needed plug-in support. I found Jonas Forsberg post entitled [Jekyll + Heroku + Unicorn = Blazing fast blogging](http://jonasforsberg.se/2012/07/22/jekyll-heroku-unicorn) and basically followed the step outlined below.

	sudo gem install heroku
		
	sudo gem install bundler

 	heroku auth:login
 	
 	git clone git@github.com:himynameisjonas/jekyll-heroku-unicorn.git
 	
 	cd jekyll-heroku-unicorn
 	
 	bundle install
 	
 	heroku create
 	
 	git push heroku master

Okay that failed.

	Running: bundle install --without development:test --path vendor/bundle --binstubs bin/ --deployment
	You are trying to install in deployment mode after changing
	your Gemfile. Run `bundle install` elsewhere and add the
	updated Gemfile.lock to version control.
	You have added to the Gemfile:
	* source: https://github.com/adaoraul/ra... (at master)
	You have deleted from the Gemfile:
	* source: git://github.com/adaoraul/rack... (at master)
	You have changed in the Gemfile:
	* rack-jekyll from `https://github.com/adaoraul/ra... (at master)` to `no specified source`
	
Okay now what.

I searched around and found an nice little how-to guide, [Jekyll on Heroku](http://www.thomas.stachl.me/blog/2012/05/26/jekyll-on-heroku.html) by Thomas Stachl. It seem straight forward, yet it to failed.

I looked around some more, and stumbled on [eploying Jekyll sites to Heroku with Rack-Jekyll](http://www.mikemayo.org/2012/deploying-jekyll-sites-to-heroku-with-rack-jekyll) which gave two little snippets of code.

	gem 'rack-jekyll', :git => 'https://github.com/adaoraul/rack-jekyll.git', :require => 'rack/jekyll'

and

	require 'bundler'
	Bundler.require(:default, :production)
	
	run Rack::Jekyll.new
	
Ah-ha, why not meld all of this goodness together. Drat, another failure.

	Heroku push rejected, no Cedar-supported app detected
	
Hmmm, wait bundler isn't the app I wish to deploy... thinking. Eureka!

My Gemfile, compilation which I'm sure I can trim down to the bare essentials.

	source :rubygems

	gem "rake"                # actually not need for heroku but for the provided Rakefile
	gem "RedCloth"            # if you want to use the Textile Markup Language
	#gem "jekyll", "~> 0.11.2" # we need at least this version so jekyll will use Ruby 1.9.2
	gem 'rack-jekyll', :git => 'https://github.com/adaoraul/rack-jekyll.git', :require => 'rack/jekyll'
	#gem "foreman"             # this is a tool to test and use the Procfile locally
	gem "heroku"              # if you install the Heroku Toolbelt you won't need this but it's good practice
	gem 'unicorn'
	
Along with my config.ru file

	require 'bundler'
	require "rack/jekyll"
	Bundler.require(:default, :production)
	
	run Rack::Jekyll.new(:destination => 'public')
