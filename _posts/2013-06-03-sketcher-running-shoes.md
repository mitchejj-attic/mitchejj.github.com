This may sound like a horror story at first but I assue you it isn't. I wanted to find a lightweight shoe comfortable to wear daily, with a low toe to heal drop. However this shoe wasn't intended to be used for daily use but as a gym workout shoe. Over the winter I've been eyeing up the GOrun[^goRunNote] line from a distance and few weeks ago I stopped by my local Skechers Outlet, and picked up a new pair of shoes. I know, I'm bad for buying running shoes from a 'big box' store let alone an outlet. Don't judge me just yet, I went shopping for work shoes and walked out with a pair of work shoes and [Skechers GOrun m][goRun]

So fair I must say I'm impressed. I've been breaking them in walking around in daily life. I've also taken them for more than a few runs and gym trips. I did try useing the shoe without the shoe linners for one run and I didn't care for the feel much. I was ammazed how much of a difference using shoe linners make to a shoe.
 
Overall I must say this my current favoite shoe in my closset. I just don't know if I could run any real distance in such a bare shoe for me. In the past I've used beef-er shoes. They say to take the transistion to minimal shoes slow, use caution. I did buy a pair of Brooks Pure Flow last spring and started the transistion then... I did enjoy that shoe as well. Hoever between the two I think the Go Run M is a bit more durablitly with one exception. The shoe laces seem to me more style over substance. The Flow fits a bit better around my heel.

[goRun]: somethin
[goRunNote]: the goRun has a 4mm drop, and on a geekier note to bad Skechers didn't fallow camal case and name the shoe goRun or goRUN.
