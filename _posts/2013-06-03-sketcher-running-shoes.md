This may sound like a horror story at first but I assure you it isn't. I wanted to find a lightweight shoe comfortable to wear daily, with a low toe to heal drop. However this shoe wasn't intended to be used for daily use but as a gym workout shoe. Over the winter I've been eyeing up Sketchers GOrun[^goRunNote] line from a distance. Just a few weeks ago I stopped by my local Skechers Outlet, and picked up a new pair of shoes. I know, I'm bad for buying running shoes from a 'big box' store let alone an outlet. Don't judge me just yet, I went shopping for work shoes and walked out with a pair of work shoes and [Skechers GOrun m][goRun]

So far I must say I'm impressed as they just find a way on my feet., I've taken them few runs and gym trips. I did try going for a run without the insole liners. I was amazed how much of a difference the liners makes; I can see why people would enjoy this feel however after one run I don't its for me. 
 
Overall I must say the GOrun m is currently favorite shoe. I don't know if I could run any real distance in such a bare shoe, I am going to try. I started my transition to a 'minimal shoe' last year with the Brooks Pure Flow, I enjoyed the fit and feel of that shoe as well. As a whole I think the Pure line is was constructed to a higher standard. The only exception to that is the sole, feel the GOrun will last a bit longer as the miles build up.

[goRun]: somethin
[goRunNote]: the goRun has a 4mm drop, and on a geekier note to bad Skechers didn't fallow camel case and name the shoe goRun or goRUN.
