This summer I've accomplished a few task, and a few where placed on the back burner. After completing the summer vacation project, and then sitting on it, I finally did install Arch on my main laptop. I learned a good deal along the way and I am fairly happy with the end results. I may have a more indept install 'report' detailing some of my choices. I may push that off until I finish my next Arch install project, my Mac Mini with a functional OS X VM environment.

I feel my running as been a success thus far. I've been able to put in a few 14-mile completing them faster than my fastest half marathon time. However, I feel as if my endurance isn't where I want it just yet. My nutrition is far from ideal this close to Marathon Weekend.

And finally, I spent a few weeks slowly moving to Bootstrap3, and I think I finally transitioned everything over. I also made a few slight changes to the 'theme'. I like the current design, I feel it is clean & simple; yet something is lacking. I've also yet to make a dent into learning Ruby via the [Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0 (4th edition): The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide][rubyBook].

Overall for the summer  I'm a head in some area's and behind in others. I might have a net gain of +1... whatever that might mean.
