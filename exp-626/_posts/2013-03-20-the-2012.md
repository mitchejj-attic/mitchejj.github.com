I started writing this on my plane trip back home from Florida after completing my first marathon in January. It sat in my draft folder, and sat some more. This time I will publish.

In 2012 I ran the Chicago Rock 'n' Roll Half along with the Walt Disney World Wine and Dine. The Chicago Rock 'n Roll went far better than I could have expected, while the Wine & Dine went far worse than I could have imagined.

* 5K -- 32:59
* 10K -- 1:06:36
