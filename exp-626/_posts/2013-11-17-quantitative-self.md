My final vacation for the year is just around the corner, which of course I'm looking forward to. I have spent the last week thinking of different projects I want to tackle over the week. I of course want to fin down some of the details to my January vacation plans... the quantitative self side of things.

I played my order for the Magellan Echo, which I plan on using all four days of the Dopey Challenge. When I started my running journey I didn't know if this running thing would stick with me long term. I had no reason to think about buying a running watch, my iPhone everything I needed and then some. It still does, but I hate arm bands and would like to have indulge in my quantitative self data at various points along my runs.

Early on I tried the ever so popular RunKeeper, something about it just didn't feel right. I might have been I felt like my quantitative self data was being locked into the RunKeeper ecosystem. I found my escape with Runmeter and since version 9.1.1 all of the *meter apps have supported the Wahoo Fitness RFLKT 'bike computer' display system. While Abvieao has been quite of the the Echo, apparently the Echo is essentially a RFLKT wearable device... and the Wahoo Fitenss app supports Echo so I hope I can use use the Echo with Runmeter. I surely hope it does, and I definitely will be spending a portion of my vacation tinkering with the the different screens.

**UPDATE:**
