According the the Arch [MacBook wiki page][macBookWiki], the MacBook's iSight camera should just work out of the box since kernal 2.6.26. Well that maybe the case on new hardware[^newMac], older hardware[^oldMac] doesn't have the iSight camera just work. One must first do some work, like finding the drivers `AppleUSBVideoSupport`. The driver can be found on any Mac OS X system, however it must come Mac OS X pre-10.6, so just just google it.

Install `isight-firmware-tools` from the AUR (you will need `base-devel`):

	bash <(curl aur.sh) -si isight-firmware-tools

Once the drive is found and tools are installed the easy part is putting it all together:
 
	# ift-extract --apple-driver AppleUSBVideoSupport
	# sudo reboot

The driver will be 'extracted' to `/lib/firmware/isight.fw` loaded at reboot[^skipReboot] with an udev rule.

[^newMac]: MacBookPro (6,2), MacBookPro (9,2)
[^oldMac]: MacBook (2,1), MacBook (4,1)
[^skipReboot]: /usr/lib/udev/ift-load --firmware /lib/firmware/isight.fw
