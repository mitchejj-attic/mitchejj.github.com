### The Manifesto  of Proclamation

A year a go I wanted to find an escape from my Google dependency. The first step was finding a way of Google Mail (gMail). I ran many ideas thru my Domain Register of choice (hover.net), nothing stuck. I wanted something short and easy to type. I wanted something to tie in with both my geek side and my emerging heath consciousness. I eventually settled on stderr.me.

	stderr == Standard Error

#### Why?
Well a few reasons. First, we all have ‘errors’ in our daily lives. They could be technology related, heath related or just our personalties. I order to resolve these errors they need to be exposed to the world. Second, the me domain was cheap.

#### Servers
With my new domain name in hand I went shopping for an email provider. I didn’t really like any of the choice. They all worked but nothing really stood out. I’m not a heavy email user, and I just don’t want spam in my inbox. In the back of my mind I knew I had a ‘lifetime’ shared hosting account from Joyent. A very cheap option, but what about spam? I heard many ads about mailroute.net being very good eliminating spam. A yearly account for 1 address is the same price the other solutions cost, plus I had a 10% off coupon code for the life of my plan.

#### Blog
Once I partially migrated away from Google I felt need to have a web presence yet again. I just didn’t want to host something myself, watch and track security issues. So I chose to use tumblr. They had a nice community and had an easy to use domain mask scheme. I built out a working theme, yet I found myself annoyed with how somethings work on tumblr. As a result I just didn’t use it as much as I hoped.

#### Search
Like I said I wanted to move away from Google, and I found the perfect replacement DuckDuckGo.


#### A perfect storm
Over the last few weeks I’ve been in deep personal reflection, I need a change in life.

I love many aspects of my current job, in the end it doesn’t leave me satisfied like it used to. I started at my current job 10 years ago, at that time I knew it wasn’t something I wanted to do long term. Over time it became comfortable, while I found new ways to justify to myself why I should stay. It is time to move on, I need to start scrapping away that rust and engage in the tech community again.

#### A new leaf
Going forward I hope to find a new word life balance. It is my intention going forward to spend atleast an hour every other day mucking about on this "project"

#### Less than Beta Quality
This here will be my playground. Things may work, things may not work and things may break. As a result, nothing here should be considered finished, polished, refined or ready for mass consumption.
