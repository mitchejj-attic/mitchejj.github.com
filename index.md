### whoami
I'm Jason and this is my new online dwelling. I graduated [Grand Valley State University](http://gvsu.edu) with a degree in Computer Science. I however, have not put my degree to any use since graduation. Instead I opted to work for [Panera Bread](http://panerabread.com). Thanks to this experience learned a lot and grown as an individual. Here will live digital workspace and playground. I will share personal thoughts, refine my writing style and explore different technologies and methodologies. Things may work, things may not work and things may break. As a result, nothing here should be considered finished, polished, refined or ready for mass consumption.

Sometime in the summer of 2011 I wanted to find an escape from my Google dependency. The first step was to move away from Google Mail (gMail), with that change I wanted to use my own domain. I wanted a short URL that could tie into both my geek side and my emerging heath consciousness, nothing unreasonable. I ran many ideas thru my Domain Register of choice [hover.com](https://www.hover.com/), nothing resonated with until [stderr.me](http://stderr.me).

	stderr == Standard Error

stderr.me has now become my "personal brand," and honestly I don't think it is all that ideal to brand oneself as a standard error. However, it works.. for now. 


#### Why?
Well, a few reasons. First, we all have ‘errors’ in our daily lives. They could be technology related, heath related or just our personalties. I order to resolve these errors they need to be exposed to the world. Second, the me domain was cheap.

#### Servers
With my new domain name in hand I went shopping for an email provider. I didn’t really like any of the choice. They all worked but nothing really stood out. I’m not a heavy email user, and I just don’t want spam in my inbox. In the back of my mind I knew I had a ‘lifetime’ shared hosting account from Joyent. A very cheap option, but what about spam? I heard many ads about mailroute.net being very good eliminating spam. A yearly account for 1 address is the same price the other solutions cost, plus I had a 10% off coupon code for the life of my plan.

#### Blog
Once I partially migrated away from Google I felt need to have a web presence yet again. I just didn’t want to host something myself, watch and track security issues. So I chose to use tumblr. They had a nice community and had an easy to use domain mask scheme. I built out a working theme, yet I found myself annoyed with how somethings work on tumblr. As a result I just didn’t use it as much as I hoped.

#### Search
Like I said I wanted to move away from Google, and I found the perfect replacement DuckDuckGo.


#### A new leaf
Going forward I hope to find a new word life balance. It is my intention going forward to spend atleast an hour every other day mucking about on this "project"

#### Less than Beta Quality
This here will be my playground. Things may work, things may not work and things may break. As a result, nothing here should be considered finished, polished, refined or ready for mass consumption. My main quality goal is to keep the site light and nimble.
